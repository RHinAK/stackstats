    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I add a cryptocurrency to my portfolio?</strong>
        <p>From your portfolio view, tap the <strong>+</strong> button. Search for the cryptocurrency you want to add, then enter your transaction details — amount purchased, price paid, and date. StackStats will calculate your cost basis automatically.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What is DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging)?</strong>
        <p>DCA is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount at regular intervals, regardless of the price. StackStats tracks your DCA performance by showing your average cost per coin, how your recurring purchases have performed over time, and whether your strategy is outperforming lump-sum investing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Where do the prices come from?</strong>
        <p>StackStats uses the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/">CoinGecko API</a> for real-time cryptocurrency prices. No personal data is sent — only the coin identifiers needed to fetch current market prices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Is my data private?</strong>
        <p>Yes. All your portfolio data is stored locally on your device. We don't have servers, we don't collect your data, and we never sell anything to anyone. Your portfolios, transactions, and investment history stay on your iPhone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How does iCloud sync work?</strong>
        <p>With StackStats Plus, you can enable iCloud sync to keep your portfolios in sync across all your Apple devices. The data syncs through your personal iCloud account — we never have access to it. Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID on all devices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>Can I export my data?</strong>
        <p>Yes! With StackStats Plus, you can export your portfolio and transaction data as CSV (for spreadsheets) or generate a PDF report. This is especially useful for tax preparation. Go to your portfolio settings to find the export options.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>How do I manage or cancel my subscription?</strong>
        <p>Go to <strong>Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</strong> on your iPhone, find StackStats, and tap Cancel Subscription. You'll keep Plus access until the end of your current billing period.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>I'm not seeing my subscription / features are locked</strong>
        <p>Try these steps: (1) Make sure you're signed into the same Apple ID you used to subscribe. (2) Open the app's settings and tap "Restore Purchases." (3) Restart the app. If the issue persists, contact us.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq">
        <strong>What happens if I delete the app?</strong>
        <p>Your data is stored locally, so deleting the app will remove your data. We strongly recommend exporting your data before uninstalling. If you had iCloud sync enabled, your data may still be recoverable after reinstalling.</p>
