# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: February 4, 2025**

StackStats ("the App") is developed by Rodney Hughey. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Data Collection

**StackStats does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

All portfolio data you enter (assets, transactions, quantities) is stored locally on your device only. We have no access to this information.

## What We Don't Do

- We do not create user accounts
- We do not require registration
- We do not sync data to the cloud
- We do not track your location
- We do not sell or share any data (we don't have any to share)

## Third-Party Services

### Apple App Store

If you purchase a subscription, Apple processes the transaction. Apple's privacy practices are governed by their own Privacy Policy at [apple.com/privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

### Price Data

The App may fetch publicly available cryptocurrency price data from third-party APIs. These requests do not include any personal or portfolio information.

## Local Storage

Your portfolio data is stored using Apple's standard on-device storage. This data:

- Remains on your device
- Is included in your iCloud/device backups (if you have backups enabled)
- Is deleted when you uninstall the App

## Children's Privacy

StackStats is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy
